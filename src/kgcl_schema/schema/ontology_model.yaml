title: knowledge graph change language ontology model
description: A basic bare-bones model of an ontology or ontology-like structure. The
  purpose is not to provide a complete model, rather just sufficient structure for
  domain and range constraints in the ocl model

    description: "A relationship between two nodes.\nCurrently the only kinds of edges\
      \ supported in KGCL:\n\n  * A subClassOf B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=owl:subClassOf,\
      \ object=B)\n  * A subClassOf P some B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B)\n\
      \  * P subPropertyOf Q <==> Edge(subject=P, predicate=owl:subPropertyOf, object=Q)\n\
      \nThese represent the most common kind of pairwise relationship between classes,\
      \ and classes are the dominant node type in ontologies.\n  \nIn future a wider\
      \ variety of OWL axiom types will be supportedn through the use of an additional\
      \ edge property/slot to indicate the interpretation of the axiom, following\
      \ owlstar (https://github.com/cmungall/owlstar).\nFor example:\n * `A subClassOf\
      \ R only B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B, interpretation=AllOnly)`\n\
      \ * `A Annotation(P,B) <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B, interpretation=annotationAssertion)`\n\
      \nNote that not all axioms are intended to map to edges. Axioms/triples where\
      \ the object is a literal would be represented as node properties. Complex OWL\
      \ axioms involving nesting would have their own dedicated construct, or may\
      \ be represented generically. These are out of scope for the current version\
      \ of KGCL"
