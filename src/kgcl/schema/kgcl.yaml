    comments:
    - Note there is not yet consensus in how this should be done in rdf/owl implementations.
      Simply marking the edge deprecated with render it visible to most clients. Care
      must be taken because simply adding a deprecation tag to an axiom does not silence
      it -- it is still asserted. It is therefore more common to obsolete an edge
      by shadowing the axiom as an annotation. See the Mondo docs for example
